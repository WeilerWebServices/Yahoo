EGADS Java Library
==========================================================

EGADS (Extensible Generic Anomaly Detection System) is an open-source Java package to automatically detect anomalies in large scale time-series data.
EGADS is meant to be a library that contains a number of anomaly detection techniques applicable to many use-cases in a single package with the only dependency being Java.
EGADS works by first building a time-series model which is used to compute the expected value at time *t*. Then a number of errors *E* are computed by comparing the expected
value with the actual value at time *t*. EGADS automatically determines thresholds on *E* and outputs the most probable anomalies. EGADS library can be used in a wide
variety of contexts to detect outliers and change points in time-series that can have a various seasonal, trend and noise components.

How to get started
===========================

EGADS was designed as a self contained library that has a collection of time-series and anomaly detection models
that are applicable to a wide-range of use cases. To compile the library into a single jar, clone the repo and type the following:

```shell
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

You may have to set your `JAVA_HOME` variable to the appropriate JVM. To do this run:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/{JVM directory for desired version}
```

Usage
==========================

To run a simple example type:

```shell
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=src/test/resources/log4j2.xml -cp target/egads-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.yahoo.egads.Egads src/test/resources/sample_config.ini src/test/resources/sample_input.csv
```

which produces the following picture (Note that you can enable this UI by setting `OUTPUT` config key to `GUI` in `sample_config.ini`).

![gui](doc/ui.png "EGADS GUI")

One can also specify config parameters on a command line. For example to do anomaly detection using Olympic Scoring as a time-series model and a density based method as an anomaly detection model use the following.

```shell
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=src/test/resources/log4j2.xml -cp target/egads-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.yahoo.egads.Egads "MAX_ANOMALY_TIME_AGO:999999999;AGGREGATION:1;OP_TYPE:DETECT_ANOMALY;TS_MODEL:OlympicModel;AD_MODEL:ExtremeLowDensityModel;INPUT:CSV;OUTPUT:STD_OUT;BASE_WINDOWS:168;PERIOD:-1;NUM_WEEKS:3;NUM_TO_DROP:0;DYNAMIC_PARAMETERS:0;TIME_SHIFTS:0" src/test/resources/sample_input.csv
```

To run anomaly detection using no time-series model with an auto static threshold for anomaly detection, use the following:

```shell
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=src/test/resources/log4j2.xml -cp target/egads-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.yahoo.egads.Egads "MAX_ANOMALY_TIME_AGO:999999999;AGGREGATION:1;OP_TYPE:DETECT_ANOMALY;TS_MODEL:NullModel;AD_MODEL:SimpleThresholdModel;SIMPLE_THRESHOLD_TYPE:AdaptiveMaxMinSigmaSensitivity;INPUT:CSV;OUTPUT:STD_OUT;AUTO_SENSITIVITY_ANOMALY_PCNT:0.2;AUTO_SENSITIVITY_SD:2.0" src/test/resources/sample_input.csv
```
To embed the EGADs library in an application, pull the compiled JAR from JCenter by adding the proper repository. For example in a Maven POM file add:

```
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jcenter</id>
    <url>https://jcenter.bintray.com/</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
Then import the dependency, e.g.:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.yahoo.egads</groupId>
  <artifactId>egads</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Overview
========
While rapid advances in computing hardware and software have led to powerful applications,
still hundreds of software bugs and hardware failures continue to happen in a large cluster
compromising user experience and subsequently revenue. Non-stop systems have a strict uptime
requirement and continuous monitoring of these systems is critical. From the data analysis point of view,
this means non-stop monitoring of large volume of time-series data in order to detect potential faults or anomalies.
Due to the large scale of the problem, human monitoring of this data is practically infeasible which leads us to
automated anomaly detection. An anomaly, or an outlier, is a data point which is significantly different from the rest of
the data. Generally, the data in most applications is created by one or more generating processes that reflect the functionality of a system.

When the underlying generating process behaves in an unusual way, it creates outliers. Fast and efficient identification of these outliers is useful
for many applications including: intrusion detection, credit card fraud, sensor events, medical diagnoses, law enforcement and others.
Current approaches in automated anomaly detection suffer from a large number of false positives which prohibit the usefulness of these systems in practice.
Use-case, or category specific, anomaly detection models may enjoy a low false positive rate for a specific application, but when the characteristics of
the time-series change, these techniques perform poorly without proper retraining.

EGADS (Extensible Generic Anomaly Detection System) enables the accurate and scalable detection of time-series
anomalies. EGADS separates forecasting and anomaly detection two separate components which allows the person to add her own models into any
of the components.

Architecture
===========

The EGADS framework consists of two main components: the time-series modeling module (TMM), the anomaly detection module (ADM).
Given a time-series the TMM component models the time-series producing an expected value later consumed by the ADM that computes anomaly scores.
EGADS was built as a framework to be easily integrated into an existing monitoring infrastructure. At Yahoo,
our internal Yahoo Monitoring Service (YMS) processes millions of data-points every second. Therefore, having a scalable,
accurate and automated anomaly detection for YMS is critical. For this reason, EGADS can be compiled into a single light-weight jar and deployed easily at scale.

The TMM and ADM can be found under `main/java/com/yahoo/egads/models`.

The example of the models supported by TMM and ADM can be found in in the two table below. We expect this collection of models to grow
as more contribution is put forward by the community.
