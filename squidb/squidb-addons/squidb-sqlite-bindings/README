When building from source, the jni/sqlite directory should also include the SQLite amalgamation source files, sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c.
They are not checked into version control, but can be downloaded from http://sqlite.org/download.html.
Pre-built binaries from the latest version of SQLite are included in the libs directory. If you are including your own amalgamation files that use a different or altered version of SQLite, invoke ndk-build from the jni directory to rebuild the native libraries.

How to add and build SQLite sources:
Download and unzip the SQLite amalgamation from http://sqlite.org/download.html
# cp path_to_amalgamation/sqlite3.h squidb/squidb-addons/squidb-sqlite-bindings/jni/sqlite
# cp path_to_amalgamation/sqlite3.c squidb/squidb-addons/squidb-sqlite-bindings/jni/sqlite
# cd squidb/squidb-addons/squidb-sqlite-bindings/jni
# ndk-build clean
# ndk-build
