  <h1>Database Metrics Page</h1>
  <p>This page displays a selected set of charts for performance metrics gathered
     from MySQL global status and SNMP which we think are most common for performance analysis. 
     You can also access all the metrics gathered for any specific database server,
     or compare and research interrelationships among multiple metrics. Further more,
     you can view and compare any metrics for a set of database servers.
     It no time range is selected, it will display chart for past 24 hours. 
     Additional metrics can be added using <a href="udm.htm">UDM</a>.
