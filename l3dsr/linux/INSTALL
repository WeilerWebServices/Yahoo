These packages supply an Iptables plugin and kernel module and that
allow rewriting of the destination IP address for IPv4 and IPv6.

To build both components of the software, type:

    $ make

If your system is relatively current, the iptables plugin will
be in extensions-1.4/libxt_DADDR.so and the kernel module in
kmod-xt/xt_DADDR.ko.

If your build fails to compile, you may need to adjust "def_kmoddir"
and/or "def_lmoddir" to point to one of the other directories
(extensions-1.{2,3} or kmod-{ipt,xt-older}) for older systems.


To install the components, you need to specify the base library path
with the "libdir" make macro.  Set it to where your system has its
iptables library modules.  This example assumes it is "/usr/lib64"
(common for some distros running on 64-bit architectures):

    $ sudo make libdir=/usr/lib64 install

If the directory name used for iptables library modules is incorrect
for your system, you may need override it by giving the full path
for the library modules using "ipt_libdir".  For example:

    $ sudo make ipt_libdir=/usr/lib/iptables install


For RPM-based distros, to build the binary packages, type:

    $ make rpm-pkgs

The RPMs will be under:

    $ ls -lR `rpm -E %_topdir`/{RPMS,SRPMS}

You may want to override %_topdir by setting the make macro TOPDIR:

    $ make TOPDIR=$PWD/topdir rpm-pkgs


If you have mock installed, type:

    $ make mock-pkgs

You may want to add the macro definition MOCK="sudo mock" to the line.

The RPMs will be in:

    $ ls -lR mock/results_*/*.rpm


If you want to build packages for a system using something other
than the provided "rpm" or "mock", you can create your own directory
and add your packaging files there then provide the directory to the
Makefile to call it with the PPS make macro.  For example, if your
directory is "deb", you could call it with:

    $ make PPS=deb deb-pkgs

If you are happy with your efforts, please submit a pull request to
include your new files in the repository.

If you need to provide new make macros or change the default settings
for existing ones, you may optionally provide at the top level a
"package-local.mk" file which will be automatically included by
subdirectory Makefiles.

With the PPS macro and "package-local.mk", these should substantially
reduce the need to modify provided files when building source or
packages for your environment.
