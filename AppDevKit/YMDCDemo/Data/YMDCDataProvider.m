The film follows a Cat's plan to destroy a new vaccine, that if developed, would destroy all human allergies to Dogs, and the Dogs' efforts to stop the Cats. Specifically, it's the story of a young pup whose job it is to guard the vaccine. Other dogs include a wise older dog who watches out for him, a large friendly dog, and a small dog who serves as an electronics expert. Jeff Goldblum is the human scientist that invented the vaccine.";
