This directory constains MDBM Code samples.
-------------------------------------------

mdbm_exclusive.cc - simple example code that performs store/fetch/delete using exclusive locks
mdbm_partition.cc - example code that performs store/fetch/delete using partitioned locks
mdbm_shared.cc    - example code that performs fetch using shared locks, store/delete by getting

mdbm_windowed.cc  - example code that sets up windowed access to an MDBM, and then performs
                    store/fetch/delete using exclusive locks.
mdbm_cache.cc     - example code that illustrates how to use an MDBM as a (small) cache.
mdbm_backstore.cc - example code that illustrates how to use an MDBM with a cache and backing
                    store.

You can compile them into an executable by:
make executable_name

For example:
make mdbm_exclusive
make mdbm_partition
...

to run:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to-libmdbm.so>
mdbm_exclusive
mdbm_partition
...
