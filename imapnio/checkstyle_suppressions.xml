    <!-- Suppress package-info.java checks in the unit test source folders 
        (src/test/java) with the same package as product code (src/main/java). We 
        exclude all UT classes from package enforcement, which may include test-only 
        packages such as utilities. But we cannot have the same-named file in the 
        same package at different locations or Eclipse will complain. However, only 
        command-line check-style honors this exclusion, so Eclipse check-style will 
        still complain, but at least it will not be an Eclipse compile failure when 
        you have 2 of the same files in the same package. note: Alternatively we 
        could exclude anything with "test" in the name by files="[\\/]test[\\/]" -->
    <suppress checks="JavadocPackage" files="[\\/]test[\\/]" />
    <suppress checks="MagicNumber" files="[\\/]test[\\/]" />
    <!-- Suppress all checkstyle for autogenerated jaxws.managed package -->
    <suppress checks="[a-zA-Z0-9]*" files="[\\/]target[\\/]" />
