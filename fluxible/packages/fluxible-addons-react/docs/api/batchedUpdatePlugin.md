# batchedUpdatePlugin

```js
import batchedUpdatePlugin from 'fluxible-addons-react/batchedUpdatePlugin';
```

`batchedUpdatePlugin` is a Fluxible plugin that will batch React `setState`
calls together when they are part of the same `dispatch`. This can improve
performance as there will be fewer re-renders for components that listen
to multiple stores that react to the same dispatch command.

## Example

The plugin is added to Fluxible immediately after instantiation as follows:

```js
var app = new Fluxible();
app.plug(batchedUpdatePlugin());
```

This will wrap the `actionContext.dispatch` function with a call to 
`React.addons.batchedUpdate`.
